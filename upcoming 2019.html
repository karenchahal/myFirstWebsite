    <p style="text-align: center">2019 will be a very big year for and I can honestly say I am looking forward to it! <br> <br>


        Firstly, I will be finishing my PhD in Medicinal Chemistry! It has been a long 3.5 years working on the project and it will nice to close that chapter of my life. <br>
        Hopefully it will not take too long to submit my thesis and I am looking to graduate in the summer. <br> <br>
        I have a few events lined up for the year such as going to Reading festival, friends weddings and holiday plans. <br> <br>

        Finally, of course I have my journey on <em>School of Code</em> to complete!!  I'm really looking forward to meeting new people from diverse backgrounds, working on projects and of course learning to code. <br>
